What's the trick? I wish I knew
I'm so done with thinking through
All the things I could've been
And I know you wonder too
All it takes is that one look you do
And I run right back to you
You crossed the line
And it's time to say "F... you"
What's the point in saying that
When you know how I'll react?
You think you can just take it back
But shit just don't work like that
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad
Guess I'm stuck with you
And that's that
'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
When it don't work out
For the better
If it just ain't right
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down
I'll be fine, I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine
Why we fight? I don't know
We say what hurts the most
Oh, I try staying cold
But you take it personal
All these firing shots
And making ground
It's way too hard to cope
But I still can't let you go
'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
When it don't work out
For the better
If it just ain't right
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
When it all falls down
I'll be fine, I'll be fine
You're the drug that I'm addicted to
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine
I'll be fine, fine
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I fine, fine, fine, fine
(Falling down)
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I fine, fine, fine, fine
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I fine, fine, fine, fine
(Falling down)
(All falls down)
I'll be fine, fine, fine
I fine, fine
'Cause when it all falls down
Then whatever
(Then whatever, babe)
When it don't work out
For the better
(For the better)
If it just ain't right
(If it just ain't right)
And it's time to say goodbye
When it all falls down
(When it all, when it all)
When it all falls down
(When it all falls down)
I'll be fine (Fine, fine, fine)
I'll be fine (I'll be fine)
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad
But I'll be fine (I'll be fine), and that's that
