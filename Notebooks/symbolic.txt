I don't mean to dwell, but I can't help myself
When I feel the vibe and taste a memory
Of a time in life, when years seemed to stand still
I close my eyes and sink within myself
Relive the gift of precious memories
In need of a fix called innocence
When did it begin, the change to come was undetectable
The open wounds expose the importance of our innocence
A high that can never be bought or sold
Symbolic acts, so vivid
Yet at the same time were invisible
Savor what you feel and what you see
Things that may not seem important now
But may be tomorrow
Do you remember when things seemed so eternal?
Heroes were so real, their magic frozen in time
The only way to learn is: be aware and hold on tight
I close my eye and sink within myself
Relive the gift of precious memories
In need of a fix called innocence
When did it begin, the change to come was undetectable
The open wounds expose the importance of our innocence
A high that can never be bought or sold
Symbolic acts, so vivid
Yet at the same time were invisible
